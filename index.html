<p>What if Itatí Cantoral was a cast of Orange is the New Black? Nothing but remarkable things would happen. The ultimate villain gives her ultimate performance.<br>

<p>Gathering five talented artists from all over the LATAM region, the idea was to perform the "first ever collaborative mural" with Microsoft Windows 10 Modern Devices as the enabler of the creation and execution process, so that together they could start something new. The mural consisted of five individual pieces done in different parts of Latin America that later on would be mashed up perfectly into one big 360˚ digital piece.<br>

<p>Leveraging the fame of Pablo in LATAM, while feeding Mexico's thirst for Narcos Season 3, we decided that the best way to say promote the series was to give people what they wanted: to bury Escobar and his memory. And what better way to do it than with baddest ranchera of all time, the one and only, Paquita La Del Barrio and her karaoke classic: Rata De Dos Patas.<br>

<p>Orange Is The New Black could (sometimes) be like a Mexican Telenovela: both have a dramatic storyline, catfights, and over-the-top villains. What if we turned OINTB into a Mexican Telenovela? Lightbulb! What if the most iconic telenovela villain of all time, the queen of the Internet meme herself, Soraya Montenegro, would get transferred to Litchfield terrorizing the inmates with her infamous "Maldita Lisiada" performance?<br>

<p>Ever since I was a kid people always told me, your dreams are too big you need them to fit through a door, but after all this time and seeing my big dreams come to life I understood all I needed was an excellent PM and boy did I got her. Zaida to me is a dream enabler she is a tireless worker and she will go above and beyond to make sure your biggest projects come to life. She has been behind all my great successes, such as “Soraya In Litchfield,” “Paquita Sings To Pablo,” and all the many surprises that are yet still to come. She is a sweetheart a trooper and anyone will be so lucky to have her as a team member, she does not only does her job but she will also put the creative hat from time to time to help you find solutions.</p>
